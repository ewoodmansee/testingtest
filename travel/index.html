<h1>ONTARIO:</h1>
<h2>The Traveling.</h2>

<p>Ontario's a province in Canada. It's located in central-east Canada, above the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. I'm fond of it. Apparently it's got nice peaches, though I've never had any.</p>

<p>Toronto is a city in Ontario. It's usually quite cold, and actually happens to have an eerie (as far as I'm concerned) resemblance to Seattle, WA. It, too, happens to have a strangely shaped pointly tower that you can go up and down in. It, too, has a museum that features anamatronic dinosaurs. It, too, has a quirky area that's basically the U District in certain aesthetic respects. It has a waterfront. It has an aquarium.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Seattle has more trees.</p>
