<p>Ontario is a province in Canada. Located in...well, it's technically central, emotionally east, Canada, it lies above the states of Wisconsin and Michigan. I like it. It's cold, but it's strangely familiar: I've been to a number of places and none of them have been quite as strangely familiar as Ontario has been to me. I heard they've got nice peaches. They also have a few film festivals I want to go to one day. They also, unlike the United States, have a really robust mass transit system.</p>

<p>I could talk about the other cities - and they are worthwhile and I'd rather go to them - but I'm going to talk about Toronto because I have some things to say about it and also because I need a lot of text.</p>

<p>Toronto is, as established, a city in Ontario. It's the big city in Ontario. It has a tendency to be quite cold, and it actually happens to have an eerie (at least as far as I'm concerned) resemblance to Seattle.</p>

<p>It has a distinct pointly tower that you can go up and down in. As my friend put it, when you go up one strangely shaped tower to see a city's skyline, you go up them all at once, in unison: I have to agree. I was going to take the elevator and then my heart and mind said, "No." It has a museum, that has anamatronic dinosaurs. The big difference is that their art museum devoured the Pacific Science Center; the SAM and Pacific Science Center are separated in Seattle. It has a waterfront. It has an aquarium and the aquarium happens to have a large Pacific Northwest kelp exhibit.</p>

<p>The main difference is that Seattle has more trees. Many people agree on this.</p>
